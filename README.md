This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

<!-- Overview -->
The Task Management App is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. Built with React and Next.js, this application leverages server-side rendering to enhance performance and user experience. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed while offering features such as sorting and filtering.

<!-- Key Features
Task Management: -->

Users can add new tasks with a title, description, and priority level (High, Medium, Low).
Existing tasks can be edited or deleted effortlessly.
Tasks can be marked as completed, allowing users to keep track of their progress.
<!-- Dynamic Sorting and Filtering: -->

Tasks are dynamically sorted by priority, ensuring that high-priority tasks are always displayed at the top.
A search bar enables users to filter tasks by title or description for quick access.
<!-- Responsive Design: -->

The app is designed with a clean and minimalist aesthetic, ensuring it is user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Tasks are clearly distinguished by priority, using color-coding: red for high, yellow for medium, and green for low, enhancing visual organization.
<!-- Local Storage Persistence: -->

The application utilizes local storage to persist tasks between page reloads, ensuring that user data is retained even after closing the app.
